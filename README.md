This is a Galaga remix, you have a limited number of bullets to kill all the enemies.  This game was developed with the Phaser.io Framework. There are currently two levels.

This game is in the early stages of development.  A menu system, enemies that shoot at the player, more levels and sound are a few that are in current development.


#Setup
JavaScript is located on the index.html page.
There is a little bit of setting up to do before you are able to run the game.  You will need a local web server if you want to develop on your local machine. There is a great tutorial for this and more on the Phaser website. http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started

## Credit
I got my 2D game development start from a youtube channel.  His tutorials were the fundamental start of the game.  I expanded upon his game development work and added artwork that I created in Adobe Illustrator. 
Check him out on YouTube.
